# Deployment Checklist for Vercel

## Issues Fixed:

✅ **Database File System Issue**
- Updated `lib/database.ts` to detect production environment
- Skips file operations in production/Vercel environment
- Uses in-memory storage for production

✅ **Authentication Flow**
- Updated main page to redirect to welcome page for new users
- Added production environment detection to skip database validation
- Created welcome page as entry point

✅ **Environment Variables**
- Created `.env.example` with required variables
- Added fallback for Face++ API when credentials are missing

✅ **Error Handling**
- Added `app/error.tsx` for error boundaries
- Added `app/not-found.tsx` for 404 pages
- Added `app/loading.tsx` for loading states
- Added `app/welcome/page.tsx` as landing page

✅ **Next.js Configuration**
- Updated `next.config.mjs` for serverless compatibility
- Added `vercel.json` for deployment configuration

## How to Access Your Deployed App:

1. **Visit your Vercel deployment URL**
   - You should see a welcome page explaining the app
   - Click "Sign Up / Login" to start using the app

2. **First Time Setup:**
   - Choose your gender (Male = Wallet verification, Female = Face verification)
   - Complete the verification process
   - Create your profile
   - Start swiping!

## Deployment Status:
✅ **Your app is successfully deployed!**
- The Vercel dashboard shows "Enabled" status
- No authentication configuration needed
- App uses in-memory storage (perfect for demo)

## Notes:
- The app will work without Face++ API keys (uses simulation)
- Database uses in-memory storage in production (data won't persist between deployments)
- For persistent data, consider integrating with a database service like PlanetScale, Supabase, or MongoDB Atlas
- The welcome page (`/welcome`) serves as the entry point for new users

## Testing Your Deployment:
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. You should see the welcome page
3. Click "Sign Up / Login"
4. Choose verification method and complete setup
5. The app should work normally after that
