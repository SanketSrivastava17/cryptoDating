# Deployment Checklist for Vercel

## Issues Fixed:

✅ **Database File System Issue**
- Updated `lib/database.ts` to detect production environment
- Skips file operations in production/Vercel environment
- Uses in-memory storage for production

✅ **Environment Variables**
- Created `.env.example` with required variables
- Added fallback for Face++ API when credentials are missing

✅ **Error Handling**
- Added `app/error.tsx` for error boundaries
- Added `app/not-found.tsx` for 404 pages
- Added `app/loading.tsx` for loading states

✅ **Next.js Configuration**
- Updated `next.config.mjs` for serverless compatibility
- Added `vercel.json` for deployment configuration

## Steps to Deploy on Vercel:

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment issues for Vercel"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to Vercel project settings
   - Add environment variables:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEPP_API_KEY` (optional - will use simulation if not set)
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEPP_API_SECRET` (optional - will use simulation if not set)
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production`

3. **Deploy**
   - Vercel will automatically deploy from your GitHub repository
   - Or manually trigger deployment from Vercel dashboard

## Notes:
- The app will work without Face++ API keys (uses simulation)
- Database uses in-memory storage in production (data won't persist between deployments)
- For persistent data, consider integrating with a database service like PlanetScale, Supabase, or MongoDB Atlas

## Testing After Deployment:
- Test main page (`/`)
- Test profile creation (`/create-profile`)  
- Test face verification (`/face-verification`)
- Test wallet connection (`/wallet-connection`)
- Check console for any remaining errors
