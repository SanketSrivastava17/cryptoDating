This document outlines the authentication features that have been added to the Bumble UI/UX clone.

## Features Added

- **Location**: `app/login/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Toggle between Login and Sign Up forms

### 2. Header Component
- **Location**: `components/Header.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Reusable header component
  - Shows login button when user is not authenticated

  - Integrated with localStorage for demo authentication

### 3. Protected Route Component
- **Location**: `components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- **Features**:

## Authentication Flow

1. **Initial State**: User sees the main page with a "Login" button in the header
2. **Login Process**: Click "Login" → Navigate to `/login` page → Fill form → Submit → Redirect to main page
3. **Authenticated State**: Header shows user greeting and logout button
4. **Logout Process**: Click "Logout" → Clear session → Redirect to login page

## Technical Implementation

### Form Validation
- **Library**: React Hook Form with Zod resolver
- **Login Form Schema**:
  - Email: Valid email format required
  - Password: Minimum 6 characters
- **Signup Form Schema**:
  - First Name: Minimum 2 characters
  - Email: Valid email format required
  - Password: Minimum 6 characters
  - Confirm Password: Must match password
  - Gender: Required selection (Male/Female)
  - Terms: Must be accepted

### Authentication Storage
- **Method**: localStorage (for demo purposes)
- **Stored Data**:
  - `isLoggedIn`: Boolean flag
  - `userEmail`: User's email address
  - `userFirstName`: User's first name (signup only)
  - `userGender`: User's selected gender (signup only)

### Styling
- **Framework**: Tailwind CSS
- **Design**: Follows Bumble's yellow and white color scheme
- **Components**: Responsive forms with proper hover states and transitions

## Navigation Integration

The login page is linked from the main application through:
1. Header component login button
2. Direct navigation to `/login` route
3. Back button on login page returns to main application

## Future Enhancements

For a production application, consider implementing:
1. Real authentication service integration
2. JWT token management
3. Password reset functionality
4. Email verification
5. Social login implementation
6. Remember me functionality with secure cookies
7. Session timeout handling
8. Multi-factor authentication

## File Structure

```
app/
  login/
    page.tsx          # Login/Signup page
  page.tsx            # Main page (updated with Header component)
  layout.tsx          # Root layout

components/
  Header.tsx          # Navigation header with auth state
  ProtectedRoute.tsx  # Route protection wrapper
```

## Usage

To test the authentication:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the application
3. Click "Login" in the header
4. Either login or signup with any email/password (6+ chars)
5. You'll be redirected to the main page with authenticated state
6. Click "Logout" to test the logout flow
